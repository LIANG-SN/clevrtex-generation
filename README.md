# ClevrTex For ONeRF

* This is a README for our modification of ClevrTex, please refer to the README on main branch first.

- Each scene is configured as a `.json` file in `clevrtex-gen/data/*.json`, for example, `myscene_tiger.json` is corresponsing to the first animal scene.
- `clevrtex-gen/generate.sh` is an example for running the generation process.
